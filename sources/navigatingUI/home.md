#Home Page
Login to [Shippable](http://www.shippable.com) and you'll see the Home Page of 
the Shippable portal. The Home Page gives you a summary of information across your 
subscriptions, projects and builds.

From anywhere within the portal, you can get to the Home Page either by clicking 
the 'Home' image on the top right hand navigation or the 'Home' image on the top 
left burger menu.

##Home Dashboard
The 'Dashboard' section on the Home Page shows you the builds being processed 
under the 'Inflight Runs' section and a summary of the latest builds of all the 
projects, across your subscriptions that your account has access.

By default, only the latest builds from Master branches are displayed. To change 
this default setting and include branches in the summary display, go to the 
[Project's Settings page](projects/settings/#Dashboard-Settings/) and select the 
branch to be displayed.

I'll use the example build '85 Shippable-Demo/sample_nodejs' from the picture 
shown above to explain the details included in the 'Home Dashboard' summary:

- Build status icon: Displays the status of the build - Success, failed, etc. 
Hover the mouse on the icon to get a pop up about the build status. For a complete 
list refer the [builds status page](builds/overview/#Build-status). In the above 
example, it shows 'Success'
- Build number: Displays the latest build number. In the above example, it shows '85'
- Project: Displays the name of the project and the Subscription it belongs to. 
In the above example, it shows 'Shippable-Demo/sample_nodejs' where 'Shippable-Demo' 
is the subscription and 'sample_nodejs' is the name of the project.
- Branch name: Displays the name of the branch for the project. By default, it 
is 'master'. To include other branches in this summary, go to the 
[Project's Settings page](projects/settings/#Dashboard-Settings/) and select the 
branch to be displayed. In the above example, it shows the 'master' branch.
- Build Date: Displays the date the build was run. Hover the mouse on the date to 
get additional information such as day and time. In the above example, it shows 
'Last Wednesday at 11:03 AM'. Hovering the mouse over it shows July 13, 2016 11:03 AM. 
NOTE: The dates are shown in the MM/DD/YYYY format.
- Triggered by: Displays the account name (from the source control system) that 
triggered the build. In the above example, it shows 'Shippable-Demo'.
- Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA): Displays the unique ID of the commit. You can click 
on the SHA to directly access the commit on the source control system. In the 
above example, it is 41e820fe07.
- Commit message: Displays the commit message. In the above example, it is 
'changed on_success to always for slack'.
