#Integrations
Shippable integrates with many third party services/platforms and you can leverage this by setting up an account integration and then using the integration at any point in your Shippable Continuous Integration or Delivery workflows.

This section lists all the integrations that have been added by this account. The information displayed for existing integrations are:

- Type: Icon representing the third party integration
- Name: Integration name defined at the time of creating the integration
- Master Name: Official name of the third party integration
- Master Type: Indicates the type of integration. The types are: scm (Source Control Management), Hub (Docker registries), Deploy (Container services, IaaS/PaaS providers), notification (Slack, email, Hipchat, etc.) and keys (SSH, PEM)
- Updated At: Displays the date the integration was updated
- `Edit` button: Edit the integration
- `Delete` button: Delete the integration

## Deleting an account integration

To delete an integration: Simply click on the `Delete` button for the integration you want to delete.

Delete will fail if there are any projects actively using the integration, so make sure the integration is not being used in any project before deleting it.
