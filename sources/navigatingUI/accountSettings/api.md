#API Tokens
This is where you generate, view and manage access tokens to use our [API](/api/api/).

##Adding a token
To add a token:

- Click the 'Add Tokens' button.
- Enter a token name and click on `Add` to create a new token.
- IMPORTANT: Remember to copy the token. For security reasons, the token will never 
be displayed again.

**Please remember to keep your token safe and do not share it with anyone.** If 
your token get compromised, API calls can be made on your behalf and compromise 
the security of your Shippable account. Treat your API token like an admin password.


In case this happens, just deleting the token will remove all access to the token. 
You can create a new one to replace it and make sure you update it in all external 
services that might have been using it.
