# Docker Hub integration

You will need Docker Hub integration if you want to do the following -

- Pull a private image  
- Build a Docker image which has a `FROM` that pulls a private image
- Push an image
- Use an [image resource](../../pipelines/resources/image/) as part of your CD [pipeline](../../pipelines/overview/)

##Add an account integration

* Ensure you have logged in to [Shippable](https://app.shippable.com).
* Go to your **Account Settings** by clicking on the gear menu in the top navbar.
* Click on **Integrations** in the sidebar menu.
* Click on **Add Integration**.
* Enter the following:
	* In the **Master Integration** dropdown, choose **Docker**
	* Add a friendly name for your integration
	* Enter your Docker Hub credentials
* Click on **Save**. You should now see the integration in your list of integrations.
