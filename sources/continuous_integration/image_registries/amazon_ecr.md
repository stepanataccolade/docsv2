# Amazon EC2 Container Registry (ECR)

##Adding the Integration

You will need to configure this integration to pull or push images to Amazon ECR.

1. Click on the gear icon for Account Settings in your top navigation bar and then click on the 'Integrations' section.
2. Click on the `Add Integration` button.
3. For 'Integration type', choose `Amazon ECR` from the list of dropdown choices.
4. For 'Integration Name' use a distinctive name that's easy to associate to the integration and recall. Example: `ecr-integration`
5. Enter your aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key. You can follow instructions in [Amazon's guide for Creating and Managing access keys](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html)  
12. Click on `Save`

The integration will now be available to all your continuous integration and deployment workflows.

NOTE: By default, the ECR region is set to `us-east-1`. To override and specify a desired region, you'll need to configure it in the `shippable.yml`. Here's an example, for reference.
```
integrations:
  hub:
    - integrationName: your_integration_name
      type: ecr
      region: us-west-2
```
