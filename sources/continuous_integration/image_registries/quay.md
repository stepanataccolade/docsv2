# Quay.io

##Adding the Integration

You will need to configure this integration in order to pull or push images to Quay.io.

###Getting your quay.io accesstoken

Shippable will need your `username`, `password` and your `accesstoken`. `Username` and `Password` are same as your quay login credentials but to get your `accesstoken` you will need to create an quay `application` and `authorize` the application.

A new application can be created under an Organization. To create an Organization click on the + icon in the menu and select `New Organization` then, fill in the details and hit create application.

You can see your organization listed under Users and Organizations on your dashboard. Click on your Organization that you just created, click on the applications tab which is present at the bottom of the Organization view just above Organization settings.

##Pull an image from Quay
You can pull any image you have access to, from Quay and use that to spin up your CI build container.

To pull an image, you'll need to do the following:

1. Add the Quay integration to your subscription (Required only for private repositories on Quay).
2. Configure your `shippable.yml` to associate the Quay integration for your project (Required for both public and private repositories on Quay).

###Add the Quay integration to your subscription
This step is required only for private repositories hosted on Quay. If you are using a public repository on Quay, skip this step and go directly to configuring your `shippable.yml` step.
To add Quay integration to your subscription, do the following:

1. Ensure you have logged in to [Shippable](https://app.shippable.com).
2. Select your Subscription from the dropdown burger bar menu on the top left.
3. Click the 'Settings' tab and go to the 'Integrations' section.
4. Click the `Add Integration` button.
5. Provide an easy-to-remember name for the Quay integration for your Subscription, such as `quay_integration`, in the 'Name' field.
**IMPORTANT:** The 'Name' you have entered in this step should be used in your `shippable.yml` file. Both names should be exactly the same. If not the build will fail with an error.
6. From the 'Account Integrations' dropdown select the Quay account integration created.
7. Click the `Save` button.
8. The Quay integration will show up in the list of integrations for your subscription.

###Configure Quay integration in the `shippable.yml`
To enable Quay integration for your project, add the following to the `shippable.yml` file for that project.
```
pre_ci_boot:
    image_name: manishas/myImage
    image_tag: latest
    pull: true
    options: "-e HOME=/root"

integrations:
  hub:
    - integrationName: quay_integration
      type: quay.io
      branches:
        only:
          - master
          - dev
```
While the above is a sample code for your `shippable.yml`, use the descriptions of each field below to modify the `yml` and tailor it to your requirements.

- `image_name:` value is in the format docker-registry-username/docker-registry-image-repo.
- `image_tag:` value is the tag for the image that you want to pull.
- `pull:` set to `true` to pull the image from the specified Image Registry.
- In the `env` section, you can enter any environment variables you want to be set inside your CI container. Read more about [environment variables](/continuous_integration/advanced_options/env_var/).
- In the `options` tag, enter any docker options you want to use in the docker run command. You also need to include the HOME environment variable as shown if it is not already set in your image.
- `integrationName` value is the name of the Quay integration you added to the 'Subscription' settings. It is important the name matches exactly. If not, the build will fail with an error as  [described here](ci_troubleshoot/#integration-name-specified-in-yml-does-not-match). Moreover, this account should have permissions to pull the the build image specified in the `image_name` setting.
- `type` is `quay.io`.
- [optional] `branches` section: specify the branches this integration is applicable to. You can skip this if you want your integration to be applicable for all branches.. The `only` tag should be used when you want the integration on specific branches. You can also use the `except` tag to exclude specific branches.

For more information on pulling images, refer our documentation on [pulling an image](/continuous_integration/advanced_options/images/).

##Build a Docker image which has a `FROM` that pulls an image from Quay

If you want to build your Docker image as part of your workflow for each CI run and if your 'Dockerfile' has a `FROM` which pulls a private image from Quay, then you will need to do the following steps:

1. Add the Quay integration to your subscription.
2. Configure your `shippable.yml` to associate the Quay integration for your project and add few options to ensure you are building the Docker image as part of CI.

###Add the Quay integration to your subscription
To add Quay integration to your subscription, do the following:

1. Ensure you have logged in to [Shippable](https://app.shippable.com).
2. Select your Subscription from the dropdown burger bar menu on the top left.
3. Click the 'Settings' tab and go to the 'Integrations' section.
4. Click the `Add Integration` button.
5. Provide an easy-to-remember name for the Quay integration for your Subscription, such as `quay_integration`, in the 'Name' field.
**IMPORTANT:** The 'Name' you have entered in this step should be used in your `shippable.yml` file. Both names should be exactly the same. If not the build will fail with an error.
6. From the 'Account Integrations' dropdown select the Quay account integration created.
7. Click the `Save` button.
8. The Quay integration will show up in the list of integrations for your subscription.

###Configure Quay integration in the `shippable.yml`

Add the following to your `shippable.yml` file:

```
build:
  pre_ci:
    - docker build -t myImage:tip .

  pre_ci_boot:
    image_name: myImage
    image_tag: tip
    pull: false
    options: "-e HOME=/root"

integrations:
  hub:
    - integrationName: quay_integration
      type: quay.io
      branches:
        only:
          - master
          - dev
```

- `image_name` value is the name of the image that was built in the `pre_ci` step.
- `image_tag` is the tag for the image that was built in the `pre_ci` step.
- set `pull` to `false` if you want to use the image you built during the pre_ci step instead of pulling from a docker registry.
- In the env section, you can enter any environment variables you want to be set inside your CI container.
- In the options tag, enter any docker options you want to use in the docker run command. You also need to include the HOME environment variable as shown if it is not already set in your 'Dockerfile'.
- `integrationName` value is the name of the Quay integration you added to the 'Subscription' settings. It is important the name matches exactly. If not, the build will fail with an error as  [described here](ci_troubleshoot/#integration-name-specified-in-yml-does-not-match). Moreover, this account should have permissions to pull the the build image specified in the `image_name` setting.
- `type` is `quay.io`.
- [optional] `branches` section: specify the branches this integration is applicable to. You can skip this if you want your integration to be applicable for all branches.. The `only` tag should be used when you want the integration on specific branches. You can also use the `except` tag to exclude specific branches.

For more information on building images as part of the CI, refer our documentation on [building an image](/continuous_integration/advanced_options/images/).

##Push an image to Quay

You can push your image to Quay in the `post_ci` or `push` sections of the `shippable.yml`. The main difference is that the `post_ci` section runs inside the build container and the `push` section runs outside the build container in the Shippable Agent.

To push an image to Quay, do the following:

1. Add the Quay integration to your subscription.
2. Configure your `shippable.yml` to associate the Quay integration for your project and add few options to ensure you are pushing the Docker image in `post_ci` section or in the `push` section.

###Add the Quay integration to your subscription
To add Quay integration to your subscription, do the following:

1. Ensure you have logged in to [Shippable](https://app.shippable.com).
2. Select your Subscription from the dropdown burger bar menu on the top left.
3. Click the 'Settings' tab and go to the 'Integrations' section.
4. Click the `Add Integration` button.
5. Provide an easy-to-remember name for the Quay integration for your Subscription, such as `quay_integration`, in the 'Name' field.
**IMPORTANT:** The 'Name' you have entered in this step should be used in your `shippable.yml` file. Both names should be exactly the same. If not the build will fail with an error.
6. From the 'Account Integrations' dropdown select the Quay account integration created.
7. Click the `Save` button.
8. The Quay integration will show up in the list of integrations for your subscription.

###Configure Quay integration in the `shippable.yml`

To push the Docker image to Quay in the `post_ci` section, add the following to your `shippable.yml` file:

```
build:
  post_ci:
    #Commit the container only if you want all the artifacts from the CI step
    - docker commit $SHIPPABLE_CONTAINER_NAME manishas/sample-node:tag
    - docker push manishas/sample-node:tag

integrations:
  hub:
    - integrationName: quay_integration
      type: quay.io
      branches:
        only:
          - master
```

Similarly to push the Docker image to Quay in the `push` section, add the following to your `shippable.yml` file:

```
build:
  post_ci:

  push:
    docker push manishas/sample-node:tag

integrations:
  hub:
    - integrationName: quay_integration
      type: quay.io
      branches:
        only:
          - master
```


- `integrationName` value is the name of the Quay integration you added to the 'Subscription' settings. It is important the name matches exactly. If not, the build will fail with an error as  [described here](ci_troubleshoot/#integration-name-specified-in-yml-does-not-match). Moreover, this account should have permissions to pull the the build image specified in the `image_name` setting.
- `type` is `quay.io`.
- [optional] `branches` section: specify the branches this integration is applicable to. You can skip this if you want your integration to be applicable for all branches.. The `only` tag should be used when you want the integration on specific branches. You can also use the `except` tag to exclude specific branches.

For more information on pushing images as part of the CI, refer our documentation on [pushing an image](/continuous_integration/advanced_options/images/).
