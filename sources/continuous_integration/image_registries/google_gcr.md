# Google Container Registry (GCR)

##Adding the Integration

You will need to configure this integration to pull or push images to Google Container Registry.

On the [Google Developers Console (GDC)](https://console.developers.google.com/):

1. In the top navigation bar, select the project you want to integrate with Shippable.
2. Click on the `Products and Services` menu on the top left and select 'Permissions'.
3. Select 'Service Accounts' tab and click on `Create service account`.
4. Add Service name and ID and then select `Furnish a new private key` and check `JSON`. Click on `Create`. A dialog box appears to save the keys.
5. Your new Public/Private key pair is generated and downloaded to your machine. Please store this carefully since you will not be able to retrieve this from your GDC account.

(For more on JSON keys and Service accounts, read [Google's docs](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/auth#using_a_json_key_file))


On your [Shippable dashboard](https://shippable.com):

1. Click on the gear icon for Account Settings in your top navigation bar and then click on the `Integrations` section.
2. Click on the `Add Integration` button.
3. For 'Integration type', choose `GCR` from the list of dropdown choices.
2. For 'Integration Name' use a distinctive name that's easy to associate to the integration and recall. Example: `gcr_integration`
11. Enter your JSON key that you saved earlier
12. Click on `Save`
