##Pull an image from Docker Trusted Registry
You can pull any image you have access to, from Docker Trusted Registry and use that to spin up your CI build container.

To pull an image, you'll need to do the following:

1. Add the Docker Trusted Registry integration to your subscription.
2. Configure your `shippable.yml` to associate the Docker Trusted Registry integration for your project.

###Add the Docker Trusted Registry integration to your subscription
To add Docker Trusted Registry integration to your subscription, do the following:

1. Ensure you have logged in to [Shippable](https://app.shippable.com).
2. Select your Subscription from the dropdown burger bar menu on the top left.
3. Click the 'Settings' tab and go to the 'Integrations' section.
4. Click the `Add Integration` button.
5. Provide an easy-to-remember name for the Docker Trusted Registry integration for your Subscription, such as `docker_trusted_registry_integration`, in the 'Name' field.
**IMPORTANT:** The 'Name' you have entered in this step should be used in your `shippable.yml` file. Both names should be exactly the same. If not the build will fail with an error.
6. From the 'Account Integrations' dropdown select the Docker Trusted Registry account integration created.
7. Click the `Save` button.
8. The Docker Trusted Registry integration will show up in the list of integrations for your subscription.

###Configure Docker Trusted Registry integration in the `shippable.yml`
To enable Docker Trusted Registry integration for your project, add the following to the `shippable.yml` file for that project.
```
pre_ci_boot:
    image_name: manishas/myImage
    image_tag: latest
    pull: true
    options: "-e HOME=/root"

integrations:
  hub:
    - integrationName: docker_trusted_registry_integration
      type: "Docker Trusted Registry"
      branches:
        only:
          - master
          - dev
```
While the above is a sample code for your `shippable.yml`, use the descriptions of each field below to modify the `yml` and tailor it to your requirements.

- `image_name:` value is in the format docker-registry-username/docker-registry-image-repo.
- `image_tag:` value is the tag for the image that you want to pull.
- `pull:` set to `true` to pull the image from the specified Image Registry.
- In the `env` section, you can enter any environment variables you want to be set inside your CI container. Read more about [environment variables](/continuous_integration/advanced_options/env_var/).
- In the `options` tag, enter any docker options you want to use in the docker run command. You also need to include the HOME environment variable as shown if it is not already set in your image.
- `integrationName` value is the name of the Docker Trusted Registry integration you added to the 'Subscription' settings. It is important the name matches exactly. If not, the build will fail with an error as  [described here **UpdateLink**](../continuous_integration/ci_troubleshoot/#Integration-name-specified-in-yml-does-not-match). Moreover, this account should have permissions to pull the the build image specified in the `image_name` setting.
- `type` is `"Docker Trusted Registry"`.
- [optional] `branches` section: specify the branches this integration is applicable to. You can skip this if you want your integration to be applicable for all branches.. The `only` tag should be used when you want the integration on specific branches. You can also use the `except` tag to exclude specific branches.

For more information on pulling images, refer our documentation on [pulling an image](/continuous_integration/advanced_options/images/).

##Build a Docker image which has a `FROM` that pulls an image from Docker Trusted Registry

If you want to build your Docker image as part of your workflow for each CI run and if your 'Dockerfile' has a `FROM` which pulls a private image from Docker Trusted Registry, then you will need to do the following steps:

1. Add the Docker Trusted Registry integration to your subscription.
2. Configure your `shippable.yml` to associate the Docker Trusted Registry integration for your project and add few options to ensure you are building the Docker image as part of CI.

###Add the Docker Trusted Registry integration to your subscription
To add Docker Trusted Registry integration to your subscription, do the following:

1. Ensure you have logged in to [Shippable](https://app.shippable.com).
2. Select your Subscription from the dropdown burger bar menu on the top left.
3. Click the 'Settings' tab and go to the 'Integrations' section.
4. Click the `Add Integration` button.
5. Provide an easy-to-remember name for the Docker Trusted Registry integration for your Subscription, such as `docker_trusted_registry_integration`, in the 'Name' field.
**IMPORTANT:** The 'Name' you have entered in this step should be used in your `shippable.yml` file. Both names should be exactly the same. If not the build will fail with an error.
6. From the 'Account Integrations' dropdown select the Docker Trusted Registry account integration created.
7. Click the `Save` button.
8. The Docker Trusted Registry integration will show up in the list of integrations for your subscription.

###Configure Docker Trusted Registry integration in the `shippable.yml`

Add the following to your `shippable.yml` file:

```
build:
  pre_ci:
    - docker build -t myImage:tip .

  pre_ci_boot:
    image_name: myImage
    image_tag: tip
    pull: false
    options: "-e HOME=/root"

integrations:
  hub:
    - integrationName: docker_trusted_registry_integration
      type: "Docker Trusted Registry"
      branches:
        only:
          - master
          - dev
```

- `image_name` value is the name of the image that was built in the `pre_ci` step.
- `image_tag` is the tag for the image that was built in the `pre_ci` step.
- set `pull` to `false` if you want to use the image you built during the pre_ci step instead of pulling from a docker registry.
- In the env section, you can enter any environment variables you want to be set inside your CI container.
- In the options tag, enter any docker options you want to use in the docker run command. You also need to include the HOME environment variable as shown if it is not already set in your 'Dockerfile'.
- `integrationName` value is the name of the Docker Trusted Registry integration you added to the 'Subscription' settings. It is important the name matches exactly. If not, the build will fail with an error as  [described here **UpdateLink**](../continuous_integration/ci_troubleshoot/#Integration-name-specified-in-yml-does-not-match). Moreover, this account should have permissions to pull the the build image specified in the `image_name` setting.
- `type` is `"Docker Trusted Registry"`.
- [optional] `branches` section: specify the branches this integration is applicable to. You can skip this if you want your integration to be applicable for all branches.. The `only` tag should be used when you want the integration on specific branches. You can also use the `except` tag to exclude specific branches.

##Push an image to Docker Trusted Registry

You can push your image to Docker Trusted Registry in the `post_ci` or `push` sections of the `shippable.yml`. The main difference is that the `post_ci` section runs inside the build container and the `push` section runs outside the build container in the Shippable Agent.

To push an image to Docker Trusted Registry, do the following:

1. Add the Docker Trusted Registry integration to your subscription.
2. Configure your `shippable.yml` to associate the Docker Trusted Registry integration for your project and add few options to ensure you are pushing the Docker image in `post_ci` section or in the `push` section.

###Add the Docker Trusted Registry integration to your subscription
To add Docker Trusted Registry integration to your subscription, do the following:

1. Ensure you have logged in to [Shippable](https://app.shippable.com).
2. Select your Subscription from the dropdown burger bar menu on the top left.
3. Click the 'Settings' tab and go to the 'Integrations' section.
4. Click the `Add Integration` button.
5. Provide an easy-to-remember name for the Docker Trusted Registry integration for your Subscription, such as `docker_trusted_registry_integration`, in the 'Name' field.
**IMPORTANT:** The 'Name' you have entered in this step should be used in your `shippable.yml` file. Both names should be exactly the same. If not the build will fail with an error.
6. From the 'Account Integrations' dropdown select the Docker Trusted Registry account integration created.
7. Click the `Save` button.
8. The Docker Trusted Registry integration will show up in the list of integrations for your subscription.

###Configure Docker Trusted Registry integration in the `shippable.yml`

To push the Docker image to Docker Trusted Registry in the `post_ci` section, add the following to your `shippable.yml` file:

```
build:
  post_ci:
    #Commit the container only if you want all the artifacts from the CI step
    - docker commit $SHIPPABLE_CONTAINER_NAME manishas/sample-node:tag
    - docker push manishas/sample-node:tag

integrations:
  hub:
    - integrationName: docker_trusted_registry_integration
      type: "Docker Trusted Registry"
      branches:
        only:
          - master
```

Similarly to push the Docker image to Docker Trusted Registry in the `push` section, add the following to your `shippable.yml` file:

```
build:
  post_ci:

  push:
    docker push manishas/sample-node:tag

integrations:
  hub:
    - integrationName: docker_trusted_registry_integration
      type: "Docker Trusted Registry"
      branches:
        only:
          - master
```


- `integrationName` value is the name of the Docker Trusted Registry integration you added to the 'Subscription' settings. It is important the name matches exactly. If not, the build will fail with an error as  [described here **UpdateLink**](../continuous_integration/ci_troubleshoot/#Integration-name-specified-in-yml-does-not-match). Moreover, this account should have permissions to pull the the build image specified in the `image_name` setting.
- `type` is `"Docker Trusted Registry"`.
- [optional] `branches` section: specify the branches this integration is applicable to. You can skip this if you want your integration to be applicable for all branches.. The `only` tag should be used when you want the integration on specific branches. You can also use the `except` tag to exclude specific branches.

For more information on pushing images as part of the CI, refer our documentation on [pushing an image](/continuous_integration/advanced_options/images/).
